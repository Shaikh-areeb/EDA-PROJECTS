Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset involves examining and visualizing the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. This process typically includes:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent data entries.

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key metrics such as total runs, wickets, and player performances.

Data Visualization: Using graphs and charts (e.g., bar plots, histograms, box plots) to visualize distributions, team performances, win margins, and player statistics.

Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables like runs scored and match outcomes or the impact of toss decisions on wins.

Seasonal and Team Comparisons: Analyzing performance across different seasons and comparing teams based on win rates, player contributions, and head-to-head matchups.

Through EDA, we gain valuable insights into team strategies, player efficiencies, and factors influencing match outcomes, helping to inform predictions and strategic decisions in future games.
