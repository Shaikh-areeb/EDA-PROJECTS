Descriptive Statistics: An overview of key metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of reach data.

Visualizations: A series of visual representations, including histograms, scatter plots, and time series graphs, to illustrate trends and relationships in the data.

Correlation Analysis: Identifying correlations between different variables, such as post time, content type, and reach.

Key Insights: Summarizing actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing Instagram reach based on the analysis.
