Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase involves a thorough examination of the flight prediction dataset to uncover underlying patterns, relationships, and potential insights. This step is crucial for understanding the data before diving into model development.

Key Steps in EDA:
Data Overview:

Inspection of the dataset structure, including the number of rows, columns, and data types.
Summary statistics to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data distribution.

Missing Data Analysis:

Identification of missing values in the dataset.
Visualization of missing data patterns and strategies to handle missing entries, such as imputation or removal.

Data Cleaning:

Detection and correction of inconsistencies, such as duplicate records and outliers.
Transformation of categorical variables, standardization, or normalization of numerical features as necessary.

Univariate Analysis:

Examination of individual variables using histograms, box plots, and density plots to understand their distribution.
Analysis of categorical variables using bar plots to assess the frequency distribution of each category.

Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:

Correlation analysis between features using heatmaps to identify potential multicollinearity.
Scatter plots, pair plots, and joint plots to explore relationships between variables, especially those that could impact flight predictions.

Feature Engineering:

Creation of new features based on existing data, such as time-based features (e.g., day of the week, seasonality) or interaction terms.
Evaluation of feature importance using techniques like feature selection algorithms or domain knowledge.
Visualizations:

Extensive use of visualizations to identify trends, anomalies, and patterns in the data.
Interactive plots where applicable, to enable a deeper exploration of the dataset.

The EDA provides a foundation for making informed decisions about data preprocessing and model selection, ensuring that subsequent steps in the project are based on a solid understanding of the dataset.
